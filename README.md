# Raycast-Rendering
This raycast engine takes a 2d top down scenario and renders it as a pseudo-3D scene by using raycasting and measuring the distance to the walls to determine their sizes and brightness. Everytime the screen is reloaded, a new pattern of walls is generated.

Controls: WASD for going foward, backwards and looking to the sides.Also, ArrowKey and ArrowLeft for sliding sideways.

You can experiment it on the following link: https://larrycreator.github.io/Raycast-Rendering/
